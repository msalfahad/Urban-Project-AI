## LEAD REPORT 2026-10-22 20:20 UTC

Repositories: attached Urban-Project-AI checkout (main 0bc35c72); `.work` prepared AUTOMATICALLY at start ("setup by
auto"). Working branch head moved 6380294 -> 9957cc12 (checker merges T-158, T-186, T-182, T-175, T-173, T-128 r3, T-185,
T-189, T-178; no owner commit on the engine branch). Drive readable: nothing created in the Alsenan folder since 16:00, so
no photo-review task. UrbanProjectsManager not used. Owner session 18:00 read and applied (T-189 done and merged; MS1-L
stays HELD; extra checker run kept); nothing undone or duplicated.

PROGRESS (Alsenan; released numbers unchanged: released concrete 92.77 vs freelancer 111.81 m3, -17.03 %, run A)
- STAIR / BEAM OVERLAP (structure; m3), merged: the main stair's upper flights pass through B20 (0.40 x 0.75) and B23
  (0.45 x 0.75) over 3.30 m. The released run bills both beams at full depth over the stair (checker's own DXF
  re-measure 0.990 / 1.11375 m3, 0.0 %), so the stair ledger counted the overlap twice: MS1-U 1.0548 -> 0.9976, MS2-U
  1.0588 -> 1.0014 m3 (= checker 17:18 to 0.0001); staircase system 6.790 -> 6.675 m3, of which MS1-L 0.863 HELD
  (riser-count conflict C-ST-4); vs freelancer main stair 8.131: own 4.631 (-3.500 m3, causes as in the stair reconciliation).
  Rule R-CONC-OWN-1: the line billed through the junction at full section owns the overlap; otherwise the element that
  would lose it keeps it; undefined = HELD. A reusable overlap check (owned volumes add up to the union; 35 tests incl.
  beam / slab, column / beam, neck / footing, pool wall / base) is merged, unwired. Still open (new task): the released
  stair line also runs into B20 (about 0.065 m3) and the flight feet / landings were never checked against the slabs.
- DOMES (structure; m3), merged: 2 terrace shells from the printed 442 / 190 / 10 = 2 x 2.5407 = 5.081 m3 VERIFIED; engine
  7.372 on rise = radius and 0.12 conventions = ENGINE WRONG +2.291; freelancer 4.520 for the same two (-0.561, typed
  22.6 m2) + a third dome 2.260 with no structure; tower dome, rings, drums and shell bars HELD; client change S1 never
  released. The dome part of the stair / dome line is verified; the line stays PARTIALLY VERIFIED (tower dome, stairs).
- CANDIDATE V3.0.5 (Gate B package at the checker now): candidate rebar quantity lines 12,834.52 -> 10,250.17 kg (route
  slab provisional 2,584.35 kg superseded by checked slab steel), held 15,250.79 .. 21,556.50 kg; beams 64.820 -> 65.294
  m3 (west dome ring 0.7552 VERIFIED replaces route arc bands 0.2811 of the same ring: a double count removed). Pool steel
  BLOCKED: its bar lengths were taken on the 1.15 m finished depth while the verified wall is 1.20 m (rework planned).
- PLASTER / PAINT (m2), merged: the one-room fix passed (1F east master contour 22.149 vs checker 22.1507 m, owner gross
  74.20 / net 59.45 m2, 0.0 %; 3 rooms checker-verified); house dry walls drawing-derived 1,128.32 .. 1,154.44 vs freelancer
  1,209.39 m2 (-6.7 .. -4.5 %). No engine line yet, so the scoreboard's plaster / paint cells stay NOT YET MEASURED.
- BLOCK OPENINGS (m2), merged: deductions by physical scope, checker's own DXF 3.520 / 3.960 m2 (0.0 %); 43 walls carry a
  net (476.21 m2 candidate), 28 openings HELD; freelancer deducts 122.39 m2 incl. a 9.45 m2 glazed bay our walls never
  contain. STAIR-SHAFT WALLS (m2), merged: W face own 66.049 vs 66.15 (-0.16 %); his open south side +20.11 m2 ENGINE_RIGHT.
- RAILINGS / SHUTTERS (m, pcs), READY: 38.916 m DRAWING-CONFIRMED (roofs 19.150 at printed 1.04 / 1.10 m; round-stair
  balustrade + 1F gallery 16.324; two short pieces 3.442), main-stair balustrade 16.153 m HELD, GF sea strip 6.127 m HELD
  (plan vs elevation conflict, also near the parapet chain: register ruling, never counted twice); 6 shutter leaves, m2
  HELD. Freelancer: one 'internal railing' 18.95 m only (scope UNRESOLVED); roof railings and shutters he does not have.
- Also merged: your stair calculator (UP-STAIR-015, 6 / 6 of your cases), the default guard (unwired), the five separate
  scoreboard measures, and 7 resolved lessons turned into rules + tests (each test fails on a deliberately broken variant).
- Change since 16:20: no released quantity moved; verified quantities added this period: the two dome shells 5.081 m3
  and the B20 / B23 lines over the stair (2.104 m3); scoreboard concrete Verified share stays 0 / 8 whole lines (pool,
  stair / dome PARTIALLY VERIFIED by your whole-line rule).

TEAM HEALTH (16:20 - 20:20)
- Closed slots: worker 1 16:21 -> 16:35, 18:21 -> 19:11; worker 2 17:40 -> 17:51, 19:40 -> 20:11; worker 3 17:00 -> 18:26,
  19:01 -> 19:09; checker 15:51 -> 16:30, 16:52 -> 17:20, 17:52 -> 18:01: 9 of 9 STARTED + final SUCCESS, every
  self-check PASS, every final line `ERS: read` + section. Checker 19:51 open at 20:20 (2 merges + scoreboard work
  committed); worker 1's 20:19 slot had no STARTED line yet when this report was written. Refusals: one at 17:52 (a combined
  check + merge command refused as 'Sensitive-Source Provenance'; the merge then ran alone), none since.
- One merged change broke a whole-repo gate: since the guard merge (18b12176, 17:00) the rebar firewall test fails on the
  working head (`AssertionError: ['engine/source/default_guard.py']`; I re-ran it at 20:15). No quantity is affected. It is a
  REPEAT of the 2026-10-20 cause (new engine module not declared). Fix task first in lane I (after V3.0.5 merges, same
  registry file), with a known-failure register so every checker compares test by test against one list; the queue note
  now tells the checker to run the firewall test in gate b for every new engine module.
- READY 5 (16:20) -> 4 (20:20: V3.0.5, overlap, lessons, railings; the checker has since merged overlap and lessons):
  all CAPACITY, oldest 1.9 h (was 9 h at 16:20). Verdicts 16:20 - 20:20: 9 merged, 0 rejected.
- Lead self-check PASS (codemap stale none, t061, freeze 0). Two board-commit rebase conflicts with the checker's T-189 /
  T-178 verdict commits, resolved by keeping both (their verdict cells, my status notes). Queue check after my edits:
  46 actionable rows, 0 flagged, 0 stall checks (T-017 had NO_BLOCKER: blocker named).
- This run: lane orders S T-163 r2, T-191, T-192, T-188, T-174; A T-176, T-194, T-195; I T-190, T-181, T-187, T-193.
  New: T-190 (firewall fix + known failures), T-191 (pool bar populations on the verified 1.20 m wall, both details side
  by side), T-192 (stair feet / landings vs slabs with the new overlap check), T-193 (verified pool 7.202 + dome shells 5.081
  m3 into the candidate, after the guard package), T-194 (your review plan R6: plan = elevation = schedule for every
  opening), T-195 (R9: drawing / revision register). Register +5 rulings (stair / beam ownership, overlap rule, domes, pool
  steel stale, railings vs parapet). R-12 narrowed to slabs / stairs (footings settled by the team).

Proposed lessons rows (main chat's file):
- 2026-10-22 | Stair flights inside B20 / B23 counted in both the stair ledger and the beam lines (+0.115 m3; Checker T-180)
  | each ledger measured its element as a full solid; no rule said who owns a 3-D intersection | R-CONC-OWN-1: the line
  billed through the junction at full section owns it, the other is measured net; undefined = HELD; sum of owned = union
  (every villa, every pair of structural solids) | tests/t189_overlap (normal: stair head in a beam; adverse: unknown level
  stays HELD, never deducted) | fixed (T-189 merged); stair feet / landings vs slabs: T-192.
- 2026-10-22 | A new engine module merged undeclared in the rebar firewall (default_guard.py; same as T-097 / T-056 on
  2026-10-20) | the task's acceptance named only its own tests; gate b ran only the impact-level folders | every task that
  adds an engine/ module runs the whole-repo guard tests (firewall, conftest write guard) in its self-gate and in gate b;
  one known-failure register for comparisons (process, every task) | T-190 (firewall PASS on the head; register) | open (T-190).
- 2026-10-22 | Pool bar lengths stayed on the 1.15 m finished depth after the wall was verified at 1.20 m (found by T-179)
  | a derived ledger (steel) was not re-opened when the quantity it stands on (concrete geometry) was corrected | when a
  verified quantity changes, every ledger that cites it is marked STALE and re-derived before integration (every element)
  | T-191 adverse case (a finished depth given as wall height must fail) | open (T-191).

OWNER PACKAGE
No genuine owner decision today (standard 2.7 not met by anything open). New designer-side items stay on the list for
when you choose to send them: the main-stair riser count (C-ST-4), the pool detail zones (D-57), the GF sea-front strip
(railing or parapet: plan and elevation disagree).

NEEDS FIXING
- Nothing only you can do this run. Still waiting from earlier: Kuwait specification chapters 07100, 09200, 09300, 09400,
  09900 as PDFs under 6 MB (deferred by you).

Team ids: MERGED T-158, T-186 (PARTIAL: firewall), T-182, T-175, T-173, T-128 r3, T-185, T-189, T-178; READY T-179 (Gate
B), T-164; TODO S T-163 r2, T-191, T-192, T-188, T-174; A T-176, T-194, T-195; I T-190 (after T-179), T-181; QUEUED T-187,
T-193, T-146, T-168, T-170.

## LEAD REPORT 2026-10-22 16:20 UTC

Repositories: attached Urban-Project-AI checkout (main b8ff258f); `.work` was prepared AUTOMATICALLY at start this time
("prepared ... setup by auto": the 15:20 startup fix works for the Lead). Working branch head 6380294 (7 checker merges
since 12:20: T-184, T-171, T-150 r2, T-167 Gate B, T-172, T-162 r2, T-183 r2; no owner commit on the engine branch). Drive
readable: no file created in the Alsenan folder since 12:00, so no photo-review task. UrbanProjectsManager not used.
Owner sessions 15:15 and 15:55 read and applied; nothing undone or duplicated.

PROGRESS (Alsenan; released numbers unchanged: released concrete 92.77 vs freelancer 111.81 m3, -17.03 %, run A)
- POOL (structure; m3), now checked: concrete 7.202 m3 = base 10.936 m2 x 0.40 = 4.374 + wall ring 2.357 m2 x 1.20 =
  2.828, upstand 0.15 m above the deck (outer face 1.350 m2 along 8.998 m, inside the 1.20, no extra m3). The checker
  re-read the cut itself: rim +0.30, finished floor -0.85, structure line -0.90, 0.0 % against the worker. Engine 3.495
  (-51.5 %), freelancer 12.348 (+71.5 %: pump room 3.480 and steps 0.228 on no drawing; base counted again in his 1.80 m).
  Your eight conditions: all PASS except (h) steel (R1 860.97 .. 894.43 vs R2 596.17 .. 616.66 kg, designer). Concrete
  scope VERIFIED; the pool LINE stays PARTIALLY VERIFIED (whole-line rule), so concrete verified share stays 0 / 8.
  Learned: the architectural cut draws the base 0.15 m against the structural 0.40 m printed: structure governs
  thickness, architecture governs levels (consultant item).
- STAIRS (structure; m3), merged: the stair beside the lift IS the dog-leg main stair (GF -> 1F -> 2F); the round stair is
  GF -> 1F only. Own 6.790 m3 measured + held parts vs freelancer 15.053 vs engine 4.635. Checker re-measured one flight
  of each: 1.059 and 0.972 m3, 0.0 %; lines PARTIALLY VERIFIED. Freelancer main stair +3.385 closes to 0 (his 5.3 m flight
  includes the 1.95 m floor landing; 0.28 thickness vs 0.233 drawn); his 'stair 2' 16.4 m run matches no drawing. Found:
  the engine silently drops the 1F -> 2F flights (-2.598 m3 incl. landing). It goes into the candidate with the default
  guard (new package, after the next extension).
- CANDIDATE V3.0.4 merged through Gate B: 84 lines that rested on unprinted profile values are HELD (column necks 10.856
  m3 -> HELD 3.075 .. 15.375 m3; neck steel 1,428.571 kg blocked; founding depth not printed, your Q-21 C); 3,048 lines
  byte-identical; candidate concrete WAPE 15.38 % on 3 of 8 compared (unchanged).
- FOOTING PER-METRE NOTATION (rebar; kg), merged: maximum c/c spacing; 2,769.06 .. 2,829.83 kg HELD only on the
  unprinted leg diameter (designer). The frozen 874.86 kg footing line is untouched.
- DOORS / WINDOWS (pcs and m2), merged: windows 56.771 m2 on 8 printed vs freelancer 54.931 (+3.3 %); aluminium doors
  10.560 vs 12.000 m2 (-12.0 %) = your 2.20 m door height vs his 2.40 (rule difference, not an error).
- CORNERS / PARAPETS (facade; m.l and m2), merged as one pair: physical, contract (his 1,297.35 m.l), payable half
  (648.675) and rate kept apart; his parapet third line 140.27 m.l and a 1F 1.70 m height still UNRESOLVED (designer).
- PLASTER / PAINT (m2), sent back on ONE room: GF master bed 0.02 % (passed); 1F east master contour 22.350 vs the
  checker's 22.150 m (+0.9 %), owner net 60.19 vs 59.45 m2 (+1.25 %): the room outline slips into the window-frame gap
  at both ends of the curved glazing. Small rework r3; nothing else re-opened.
- Waiting for the checker: your stair calculator (9 h), the default-value guard (holds 14.554 m3 and 1,885.36 kg on the
  released run, finds 3 silent omissions), the five separate scoreboard measures, block openings by physical scope (43
  walls now carry a net, 476.21 m2 candidate; 28 openings HELD) and the stair-shaft walls (owner manual 142.22 m2 gross
  beside drawing-derived 171.88 .. 175.14 m2; his 204.42 closes to 0: open south side +20.11 and one unexplained row).
- Change since 12:20: no released quantity moved; the candidate moved to V3.0.4 (more held, nothing invented); the pool
  concrete is the first teaching-case element VERIFIED for its concrete scope.

TEAM HEALTH (12:20 - 16:20)
- Closed slots: worker 1 12:45, 14:30; worker 2 14:08, 16:12; worker 3 12:16 (the 11:01 run, closed), 13:18, 15:57;
  checker 15:04: 8 of 8 STARTED + SUCCESS, every self-check PASS, every final line `ERS: read` + section. The checker's
  15:51 run has no final line at 16:20 (scheduler PENDING; 3 merges and 1 rejection already committed): not INCOMPLETE
  yet. If it is still open at 16:49 the new overlap guard turns that extra run into a no-op (expected behaviour).
- READY 6 -> 5 (T-158, T-186, T-182, T-175, T-173), all CAPACITY; the stair calculator has waited 9 h because owner
  slots went first all day; it is now first in the next checker run (your 15:15 order). Rejections since 12:20: 1 of 8
  verdicts (12.5 %, under the 15 % target).
- Lead self-check PASS (codemap stale none, t061, freeze 0). One board-commit rebase conflict with the checker's 16:14
  commit: resolved by re-applying my edits on its version (nothing of its verdict lost); pushed agents/control normally.
- This run: queue for 2 checker runs; T-179 (V3.0.5) claimable; new T-187 (guard + missing 1F -> 2F flights into the
  candidate, after T-186 and T-179) and T-188 (element inventory and storey continuity, your review plan R2 / R3);
  T-128 r3 first in lane A; railings / shutters now backlog-permitted; T-176 waits for the openings verdict; register +7
  rulings (staircase identity corrected); T-184 checker column filled in the reconciliation file; BOARD.md 484 -> 387 KB
  (12 rows merged on 21 Oct and 16 old notes moved to the archive unchanged).

Proposed lessons rows (the register is the main chat's file under WORKFLOW_CONTROLS section 10; please enter):
- 2026-10-22 | Engine drops the 1F -> 2F flights of a stair that spans three storeys (-2.598 m3, T-184) | storey fold in
  the stair reader: a flight is bound to one storey pair only | An element spanning storeys is listed on every storey it
  crosses; a storey with no element or line is HELD (every villa) | T-188 (normal: 3-storey stair; adverse: a stair
  that correctly ends at 1F must not flag) | open (T-187 fix, T-188 check).
- 2026-10-22 | Room contour +0.200 m at a curved glazing band (1F-11, T-128 r2) | region built from barrier buffers leaks
  into the glazing-frame cavity at the jambs (length without area) | Contour = drawn face length; a frame cavity is never
  contour; a polygon spike scan runs over every room (every villa) | T-128 r3 (normal: curved band; adverse: frame cavity at
  the jamb) | rework r3.
- 2026-10-22 | Architectural cut draws the pool base 0.15 m vs structural 0.40 m printed (Checker on T-183 r2) | two
  disciplines draw one element for different purposes | Structure governs member thickness, architecture governs levels and
  finishes; a disagreement is a consultant item, never averaged (every villa) | T-183 r2 R-POOL-8 test | consultant C10.

OWNER PACKAGE
No genuine owner decision today (standard 2.7 not met by anything open). The pool steel and the parapet types are
designer items, listed in DESIGNER_CLARIFICATIONS.md for when you choose to send them.

NEEDS FIXING
- For the main chat: the five-measure scoreboard writes a `## SCOREBOARD v2.1` heading the dashboard parser does not read
  yet (adapt the parser when it merges).
- Still waiting: Kuwait specification chapters 07100, 09200, 09300, 09400, 09900 as PDFs under 6 MB (deferred by you).

Team ids: MERGED T-184, T-171, T-150 r2, T-167 (Gate B), T-172, T-162 r2, T-183 r2; REJECTED T-128 r2 (r3 claimable);
READY T-158, T-186, T-182, T-175, T-173; TODO S T-185, T-163 r2, T-174, T-188; A T-128 r3, T-164, T-176 (after T-175);
I T-179, T-178, T-181 (after T-182); QUEUED T-187, T-146, T-168, T-170.

## LEAD REPORT 2026-10-22 12:20 UTC

Repositories: attached Urban-Project-AI checkout (main 1c559a8) + wrapper; `.work` absent at start again, `setup` by hand
worked, `board log` / `board commit` worked, no refusal. Working branch head 130e2e3 (3 checker merges since 08:20: T-140,
T-169, T-177; no owner-session commit). Drive readable: no file created in the Alsenan folder since 08:00, so no photo-review
task. UrbanProjectsManager not used. Owner sessions 09:05, 09:15, 09:40 and 11:50 read and applied; nothing undone or duplicated.

PROGRESS (Alsenan; released numbers unchanged: released concrete 92.77 vs freelancer 111.81 m3, -17.03 %, run A)
- POOL SHELL (your teaching case; structure; m3). Checker's own measurement: base 10.9356 m2 (outer D, hatch 10.935) x 0.40
  printed = 4.374 VERIFIED; wall ring 2.3568 m2 (curved part 1.0367 measured) x 1.200 = 2.828 DRAWING-CONFIRMED; shell
  7.202 m3. Engine 3.495 (-3.707, -51.5 %: half the ring read, convention 0.25 / 1.60 in place of the printed 0.40 and the
  drawn height). Freelancer 12.348 (+5.146, +71.5 %: pump room 3.480 and steps 0.228 drawn nowhere, wall height 1.80 counts
  the base again, a 0.25 m wall on no drawing). Your eight conditions: a, b, d, e, f, g PASS; c FAIL; h geometry PASS,
  steel HELD (two-zone detail vs your flat floor: designer). Line = PARTIALLY VERIFIED; verified share concrete restated
  0 / 8 (whole-line rule). What was learned: your 1.15 m is the FINISHED water depth over a drawn 50 mm build-up; the
  structure line gives a 1.20 m concrete wall (worker's 2.710 -> 2.828 m3, -4.2 % on the walls) and the wall rises 0.15 m
  above the deck finish (outer formwork / waterproofing / finish missing). Rework r2 is exactly those two faults + an
  adverse test; then the pool line can be re-judged. Not a question for you: the drawings settle it (standard 2.7 not met).
- SCOREBOARD v2 is now produced by a merged script (130e2e3) and reproduces the checker's hand table: concrete WAPE 17.03 %
  released A / 15.38 % candidate V3.0.3 on 3 of 8 compared (unchanged); plaster, paint, floor area 1 reference line each,
  HELD, NOT YET MEASURED; doors / windows NOT YET MEASURED in m2 (engine counts pieces; the pcs AND m2 task is queued).
- FORMWORK (missing category; m2): sent back. Bay GF-032 and the shaft faces 0.0 %, but column joint faces on COL-GF-19
  own 1.004 vs 1.124 m2 (+12.0 %): a beam running through the column, flush with one face, was counted across the full
  face width. The 14.224 m2 joint line and the 288.711 m2 beam sides are NOT VERIFIED until the 30 columns are re-run.
- FOOTING "PER METRE" NOTATION (rebar; kg), investigation done, waiting for the checker: "/m" = maximum c/c spacing; edge
  bars inside the boxed legs; N = ceil(L_eff / s) + 1 gives 2,769.06 .. 2,829.83 kg, HELD only on the unprinted leg
  diameter (designer). The old A / B / C figures 2,742.51 / 2,836.40 / 2,797.81 were each built on a wrong count.
- CORNERS / PARAPETS (facade; m.l and m2), waiting for the checker as one pair: physical corners 576.872 m.l measured
  + 32.200 ASSUMED (your door height) + HELD vs his 1,297.35 m.l (contract), payable half 648.675 and your 1.25 KWD rate
  kept as separate columns, never m2; parapet top 26.801 m2, inner faces 94.431 .. 99.534 m2; his parapet third line
  140.27 m.l and a 1F 1.70 m height UNRESOLVED (ST p.14 leaves three parapet types to the architectural detail: designer).
- Merged and checked 0.0 %: the wall-stub fix (free-end doorway GF-W29 physical 0.553 m), the coverage census V2.
- Change since 08:20: no released or candidate quantity moved; verified share stays 0 / 8; two hand results rejected for
  exact, small faults; scoring is now reproducible by script.

TEAM HEALTH (08:20 - 12:20)
- Closed slots: worker 1 08:32, 10:38; worker 2 10:09, 11:53; worker 3 09:24; checker 10:24, 12:07: 7 of 7 STARTED +
  SUCCESS, every self-check PASS (codemap, t061, freeze 0), every final line carries `ERS: read` + section. Worker 3's 11:01
  run (T-167 V3.0.4, claimed 11:08) has no final line yet and the scheduler shows it still running: not counted as
  INCOMPLETE; re-checked next run. Worker 1's 12:19 slot had not logged STARTED by 12:20.
- The checker clears 3 items per run while owner slots come first; READY stays at 6 (> 3). Doors / windows has waited 4
  checker runs (CAPACITY); the footing notation 2 (gate 1: it is ranked second in the next run and may not slip again).
- Lead self-check PASS (codemap stale none, t061, freeze 0). This run: queue for 3 checker runs (pool rework first when it
  lands, else the column concrete line re-measured whole in the standing slot); lane orders (S: staircases, pool rework,
  formwork rework, domes, straps; A: openings, shaft, units; I: V3.0.4, default guard, scoreboard five measures, doors /
  windows pcs + m2, lessons into tests); T-049 superseded (its "dome part closed" text withdrawn: domes stay in S0); T-170
  and T-168 queued; register +5 rulings (pool shell with the structural vs finished height, staircases / lift-shaft owner
  split, domes S0 / S1 / S2, column joint faces, corners / parapets one element two tasks); lessons register +3 rows
  (finished depth vs structure line; through-beam joint faces; re-read owner corrections before READY) and 2 statuses.

Proposed lessons rows (already entered in ENGINEERING_REASONING_STANDARD section 7): pool wall height to the structure
line, never a finished depth (T-183 r2 test); a face covered by a framing member counts that member's width only (T-163 r2
test); a handoff is checked against every owner correction newer than its claim (T-162 r2).

OWNER PACKAGE
No genuine owner decision today (standard 2.7 not met by anything open). Your 1.15 m pool depth is not being overruled:
it stays the finished water depth (water-face finish line); the concrete takes the 1.20 m the section draws.

NEEDS FIXING
- Small, for the main chat: the start-up hook still does not prepare `.work` in repo-attached sessions (every agent ran
  `setup` by hand; nothing lost).
- Checker capacity: with owner slots first it clears about 3 items a run, so READY sits at 6. If you want READY under 3 by
  tomorrow, one more checker slot a day would do it (a scheduling change only you / the main chat can make).
- Still waiting: Kuwait specification chapters 07100, 09200, 09300, 09400, 09900 as PDFs under 6 MB; designer items when you
  choose to send them.
