# Engineering invariants

Repository-level rules. They exist because each was learned by getting it
wrong more than once, in different modules, by the same reasoning.

---

## 1 · ORDER IS NEVER IDENTITY

> **Domain entities may never be joined by array position.**

Every cross-module join must use a stable id, an explicit key, or validated
geometry identity.

### Where this has already cost us

| module | what happened |
|---|---|
| `revision_entities` | a space matched by list position changes identity the moment a room is inserted |
| `connectivity` / `face_eligibility` | `cycle_capacity` sorts by cycle count, `components` sorts by length. Joining them on index scored **every component against another component's numbers** |

The second one was found only because a downstream result was absurd. There is
no reason to expect the next one to be so obliging.

### The rule in practice

```python
# NO — two lists, one index
for i, c in enumerate(components, 1):
    cycles = cycle_data[i]["independent_cycles"]

# YES — the entity carries its own value
for c in components:
    cycles = c.independent_cycles
```

Where two collections genuinely must be related, relate them by id:

```python
by_id = {c.component_id: c for c in cycles}
```

`tests/test_engineering_invariants.py` scans the engine for the shapes this
error takes.

## 2 · OBSERVATION → EVIDENCE → HYPOTHESIS → INDEPENDENT VALIDATION → PHYSICAL FACT

> **Do not promote a proxy into physical truth.**

Every stage must be nameable, and nothing may skip a stage. The proxies that
have tried to become facts in this project:

| proxy | was read as | actually |
|---|---|---|
| same raster region | "not a doorway" | the recovery signal |
| 60–120 mm separation | "not masonry" | evidence about thickness |
| same region both sides | "validated doorway" | topology evidence only |
| three correlated signals | three proofs | one construction seen three times |
| degree 4 | "a four-way crossing" | often an L corner |
| a 1.14 pt pen | "a wall" | style evidence, one family |
| **nearest parallel line** | **"the other face of this wall"** | **the mate is the one it runs ALONGSIDE** |
| a comment saying "the axes swap" | the transform | they swap **and flip** |

The last two are this round's. The pairing proxy cost every room on the sheet;
the frame proxy silently mirrored an entire round of geometry comparison.

### The rule in practice

- Two **independent evidence families** before anything is VALIDATED.
- Correlated observations of one construction are one observation.
- A single family is a hypothesis and is reported as such.
- `UNRESOLVED` is always an acceptable answer.

## 3 · MEASURE THE FRAME, DO NOT REASON ABOUT IT

A coordinate transform written as a code comment is an assumption with good
handwriting. `engine/frames.py` fits the candidate transforms against the
raster wall mask and reports the score:

```
SWAP+FLIPY   1.000        rot270   0.142
swap         0.135        rot90    0.069
```

A 1.000 against a 0.142 runner-up is a measurement. The previous inline comment
— *"on a 270-degree rotation the axes swap"* — was half right, and half right
in a transform means mirrored.

---

## 4 · NEVER INVENT THE MISSING HALF

If one wall face exists, do **not** mirror it by an assumed thickness. If a
room's boundary does not close, do **not** join its ends. If the raster says a
room is there, that says **where to look**, never **what to find**.

A printed dimension validates a candidate **after** generation. It is never an
input to the search.

---

## 5 · A LENGTH WITHOUT A BASIS IS NOT A LENGTH

A doorway is **four facts at once**:

| | BTH-05 |
|---|---|
| material present | **0 m** |
| opening | 1.054 m |
| space boundary | 1.054 m |
| host wall gross | 1.054 m |

Collapsing them into one number makes at least three trades wrong. The
previous round's *"material_length_mm is the only length a quantity engine may
read"* was one such collapse: 23010's own manual benchmark measures **gross**
perimeter and deducts openings later, so the door span belongs to the gross
line.

Every quantity engine declares which basis it consumes (`engine/lengths.py`),
and asking for an unestablished basis **raises** rather than returning zero —
an unestablished basis and a measured zero are different facts.

**Never compare unlike bases.** The 102.70 m site benchmark is a gross
perimeter; comparing it against a length that already removed doors compares
two different measurements that happen to share a unit.

---

## 6 · MATERIALS COME FROM APPROVED RECIPES, NEVER FROM AREA

Recorded now, implemented later:

```
VALIDATED QUANTITY
  → APPROVED CONSTRUCTION RECIPE
    → MATERIAL REQUIREMENT
      → PROCUREMENT ALLOWANCE
        → COST
```

Never: *AI infers materials directly from a drawing area.* The owner supplies
and approves construction recipes before they become active — block dimensions,
blocks per m², mortar, connector spacing, lintel logic, waste factor.

**CALCULATED QUANTITY and PROCUREMENT QUANTITY are always shown separately.**
A waste or safety allowance is its own approved field, never folded into a
measurement.

---

## 7 · BBOX IS NEVER PHYSICAL GEOMETRY

A bounding box **contains** a space. It is not the space.

| space | fills its own bounding box |
|---|---|
| STR-01 | **67.6 %** |
| OPEN-01 | 69.4 % |
| BED-04 | 71.2 % |
| BED-01 | 77.3 % |
| BTH-05 | 89.4 % |

STR-01's "2606 mm missing wall" was never a missing wall. STR-01 is L-shaped,
and the east edge of its box runs through open space the building never
enclosed. The engine measured a room against a rectangle it is not, then
reported the difference as a construction fact.

A bounding box may **index, localise and debug**. It may never produce a room
side, room perimeter, room closure, room area, or a missing-wall conclusion —
unless that space has been *independently proven rectangular*, which is a
separate fact with its own evidence (`engine/bbox.py`). A fill ratio is not a
proof: the missing few percent is exactly where a notch or a stub wall lives.

**And the raster outline is not the replacement.** WSH-01 proves a raster
region can carry the wrong physical identity. A raster outline localises a
search and compares against a result. It never constructs one:

```
WALL BANDS + SUPPORTED PORTALS + PLANAR TOPOLOGY  →  physical space polygon
```

---

## 8 · EXISTENCE AND GEOMETRY ARE TWO QUESTIONS

*"Is there a door here?"* and *"do we know where its jambs are?"* have
different answers and different evidence.

`SYMBOL + DOCUMENT` — the schedule says D-04 and a swing symbol is drawn — can
prove a door **exists** beyond argument while saying nothing about where it
falls on the wall line. A space-boundary edge is a piece of geometry, so
`PORTAL_GEOMETRY_STATUS` gates it, not `PORTAL_EXISTENCE_STATUS`. No family
without coordinates may fix a closure line.

Evidence is also **monotonic**: adding an observation may never lower a status.
Exact-match combination lookup broke this — a swing arc added to an approved
`GEOMETRY + SYMBOL` pair produced a three-family set that matched no row and
fell through to a lower cap. The answer is now the strongest approved
combination *contained in* the evidence.

---

## 9 · AN OPENING BELONGS TO A NAMED WALL, OR TO NO GROSS LINE

Before an opening may join `HOST_WALL_GROSS_LENGTH` it must say which wall it
is a hole in: `portal_id`, `host_wall_band_id`, both jambs, the width, the
closure line and its basis.

An opening floating between two unrelated walls closes a space perfectly well
and belongs to **no** wall's gross measurement — because there is no wall there
whose gross line it could be part of. Its host-wall length is
`NOT_ESTABLISHED`, which is not zero.

An invariant must also know **when it applies**. `HOST_WALL_GROSS =
MATERIAL_PRESENT + HOSTED OPENINGS` holds for simple hosted openings on
axis-aligned boundaries measured on one basis. It does not apply to open-plan
transitions, curved geometry, mixed closure bases, or non-hosted virtual
boundaries — and reporting `holds: True` for a room the rule never covered is
a vacuous pass presented as evidence of correctness.

---

## 10 · A STRUCTURED FIELD MAY NOT BECOME PROSE AS `None`

The workbook carried:

> "source-path fragmentation is NOT the cause — only **None** of **None**
> short marks share a path with a long run"

A missing value had been formatted straight into a sentence, and the sentence
still read as a confident measurement. The number was absent; the claim was
not.

A narrative clause is emitted only when every value it needs exists, and the
export **refuses** a workbook whose narrative columns contain `None`, `null`
or `NaN`. An absent value belongs in an empty cell.

---

## 11 · A CLOSED POLYGON IS NOT A ROOM

The regression: `WSH-01 → VALIDATED_PHYSICAL_FACE`, for a genuinely sound
1.981 m² cycle around the **hatched shaft beside the washroom**.

Nothing about the geometry was wrong. One field was answering two questions,
and they fail independently:

| | |
|---|---|
| `VECTOR_FACE_GEOMETRY_STATUS` | is this a valid closed face? |
| `PHYSICAL_SPACE_IDENTITY_STATUS` | is this face the room we named? |

`PHYSICAL_SPACE_GEOMETRY_ACCEPTED` requires **both** and is unreachable from
either alone. A shaft can have perfect geometry and a rejected identity; a
bedroom can have a supported identity and no sound polygon to attribute to it.

**One label inside one cycle is a candidate, never a validation.** A face
holding exactly one semantic label can still be a shaft, a closet, an adjacent
enclosure, a wrongly nested cycle, or the wrong side of a wall. And a *stated
contradiction* outranks any amount of supporting evidence — the support is
exactly what was mistaken.

---

## 12 · A SUM OF CYCLES IS NOT AN AREA

`bounded area = 1102.64 m²` added a 989 m² cycle to the cycles inside it. That
is not an arithmetic slip; it is a category error.

**Not every counterclockwise bounded walk is one occupiable room.** A cycle can
be the building envelope, a room, a shaft, a wall cavity, a sliver, or a
nesting artefact — told apart by CONTAINMENT and by what they hold, never by
size or orientation.

Only the ATOMIC set is additive, and only after it is checked for overlap and
for atoms nested inside atoms. `assert_additive` refuses any other total.

---

## 13 · A MEASUREMENT BASIS IS CONSTRUCTED, NOT CONVERTED

```
CLEAR ≈ CENTRELINE − PERIMETER × MEAN_HALF_THICKNESS
```

has no corner term, and inside and outside corners contribute with opposite
sign. On the L-shaped fixture it is out by exactly 0.04 m² — five outside
corners at +0.01 and one inside corner at −0.01. Mixed wall thicknesses break
it again: there is no single thickness to halve.

A clear-internal boundary is **walked** along the actual room-facing wall
faces, and its corners are the intersections of consecutive offset lines. The
room-facing face is chosen on evidence, never by being nearer; a single-face
band is `OWNERSHIP_AMBIGUOUS`. A portal closes on the **same basis as the walls
it joins**.

---

## 14 · A CONTROL CHOSEN AFTER SEEING THE ERROR IS NOT A CONTROL

The control set is defined by a rule in committed code, applied to the space
map alone, and the selector **raises** if it is handed an area, an error, a
face id or an IoU. A control that produced no geometry stays in the set as a
row saying so — dropping it would quietly turn the set back into "the ones
that worked".

---

## 15 · AN ID BELONGS TO ITS OWN NAMESPACE

Topology QA showed `component = FACE-0003`. A GRAPH component (`GC-`), a
PLANAR component (`PC-`) and a FACE (`FACE-` / `SF-`) are three different
objects; an id in the wrong column is a diagnostic quietly pointing at the
wrong thing. An empty graph component stays empty and says so rather than
falling back to whatever id is in reach.

And **do not generate an action item from a zero.** "Reduce the 0 unexplained
components and the 85 unresolved termini" asks for work that is already
finished, which makes a reader distrust the half that is real.
